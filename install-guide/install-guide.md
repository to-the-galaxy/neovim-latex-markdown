# Guide on how Neovim can be setup for Latex 

This guide assumes that Latex is already installed. If not I recommend installing using MikTex, which can are available for Manjaro in the AUR-repository or for Debian based systems via [miktex.org](https://www.miktex.org).

There are different ways to install the system, but it boils down to the following installation steps.

- Install programs via `apt` or `pacman`:
  - neovim
  - nodejs
  - python3
  - zathura (pdf-viewer)
- Install via `pip3 install`
  - pynvim
- Download from website
  - Zotero [link](https://www.zotero.org/)
- Vim plugins
